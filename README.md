## ðŸš€ Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and encoded categorical features
   - Scaled numerical features for ANN compatibility

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized churn trends
   - Identified key patterns affecting customer churn

3. **Model Building: Artificial Neural Network**
   - Built a feedforward ANN using Keras (TensorFlow backend)
   - Configured input, hidden, and output layers
   - Applied dropout to reduce overfitting

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluated on accuracy
   - Visualized performance using Tensorboard
